   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add property n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add property n/Mayfair`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `add appointment n/NAME r/REMARKS d/DATE [t/TIME]` can be used as `add appointment n/Meet John r/At M hotel d/17-2-2021` or as `add appointment n/Meet John r/At M hotel d/17-2-2021 t/2040`.
  
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME r/REMARKS`, `r/REMARKS n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/John n/Alice`, only `n/Alice` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
