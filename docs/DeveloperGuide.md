## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete property 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Due to the limitation of PlantUML, some triangles that are used to indicate class inheritance may overlap with each other.
</div>

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PropertyListPanel`, `AppointmentListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `PocketEstateParser` class to parse the user's input command.
1. Depending on the command string passed in by the user,
   * a specific command parser (e.g. `AddPropertyCommandParser`) may be created to parse the input arguments to produce the corresponding `Command` object, or
   * the `Command` object can be directly created for some commands (e.g. `HelpCommand`).
1. The `Command` object is then executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a property, deleting a property).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object, which is passed back to the `Ui`. The feedback to the user is then displayed to the user.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add property n/Mayfair t/Condo a/1 Jurong East Street 32, #08-111 p/609477 d/31-12-2021")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add property n/Bishan t/Hdb a/Blk 150 Bishan Street 11 #02-101 p/570150 d/30-06-2021` Command](images/AddPropertySequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddPropertyCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Due to the limitation of PlantUML, some multiplicities and association roles may be slightly out of place.
</div>

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences, such as
  * the preferred GUI settings (e.g. window size of the app)
  * the preferred storage filepath for the property book
  * the preferred storage filepath for the appointment book
* stores the property book and appointment book data
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Property>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Appointment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change
* does not depend on any of the other three components

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPrefs` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the appointment book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the property book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

Some examples of common classes:

* [`Messages.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/core/Messages.java): Container for user visible messages
* [`FileUtil.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/util/FileUtil.java): Writes and reads files
* [`JsonUtil.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/util/JsonUtil.java): Converts a Java object instance to JSON and vice versa

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Property component

![Structure of the Property Component](images/PropertyClassDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Due to the limitation of PlantUML, some solid diamonds that are used to denote composition may overlap with each other.
</div>

#### Implementation

A `Property` is stored in a `UniquePropertyList`, which ensures that there are no duplicate properties in the `PropertyBook`. Each `Property` is uniquely identified by its `Address` and `PostalCode`.

A `Property consists of the following mandatory attributes,
  * a `Name`: the name of the property
  * a `Type`: the housing type of the property (Hdb, Condo, Landed)
  * an `Address`: the address of the property
  * a `PostalCode`: the postal code of the property
  * a `Deadline`: the property's deadline for selling
  * a `Tag` set: a set of zero or more `Tag` objects

and the following optional attributes,
  * a `Remark`: a note about the property
  * a `Status`: represents the current stage of the selling (Option, Sales Agreement, Completion)
  * a `Client`: represents the seller of the property

A `Client` consists of at least one of the following attributes,
  * a `Name`: the name of the client
  * a `Contact`: the contact number of the client
  * an `Email`: the email of the client
  * an `AskingPrice`: the asking price of the client

#### Design Consideration

##### Aspect: How each attribute of `Property` is stored

* **Current implementation:** Each attribute of `Property` is immutable. When a property is to be edited, a new `Property` containing the updated fields will be created to replace the original `Property` object.
    * Pros: Prevent accidental modification of a `Property` object (less prone to bugs)
    * Cons: More code to be written as a separate `Property` object has to be created for each edit operation

* **Alternative:** Allow mutable `Property` objects (provide setter methods to update the attributes of a `Property`)
    * Pros: Easy to implement
    * Cons: More prone to bugs

#### Aspect: How each tag is stored

* An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `PropertyBook`, which `Property` references. This allows `PropertyBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Property` needing their own `Tag` object.
    * Pros: Prevents creating the same tag multiple times when each `Property` needs to refer to the tag
    * Cons: Harder to implement

![BetterModelPropertyClassDiagram](images/BetterModelPropertyClassDiagram.png)


### Appointment component

![Structure of the Appointment Component](images/AppointmentClassDiagram.png)

#### Implementation

An `Appointment` is stored in a `UniqueAppointmentList`, which ensures that there are no duplicate appointments in the `AppointmentBook`. Each `Appointment` is uniquely identified by its `Date` and `Time`.

An `Appointment` consists of the following mandatory attributes,
* a `Name`: the name of the appointment
* a `Remark`: a note about the appointment
* a `Date`: the date of the appointment
* a `Time`: the time of the appointment

#### Design Consideration

##### Aspect: How each attribute of `Appointment` is stored

Similar design considerations as [how each attribute of `Property` is stored](#aspect-how-each-attribute-of-property-is-stored)

### Undo feature

#### Implementation

The undo mechanism is facilitated by `PocketEstate`. It implements the undo feature with an undo history, stored internally as `previousAppointmentLists` and `previousPropertyLists` respectively.

* `AppointmentBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous appointment book state from its history.
* `PropertyBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous property book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#undoAppointmentBook()` and `Model#undoPropertyBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `PocketEstate` will be initialized with the initial appointment book state and property book state, and the currentAppointmentBookStatePointer currentPropertyBookStatePointer pointing to the two initial book states respectively.

![UndoState0](images/UndoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete appointment 1` command to delete the 1st appointment in the appointment book. The `delete appointment` executes `previousAppointmentLists.push(new ArrayList<>(appointments.asUnmodifiableObservableList()))`, causing the previous state of the appointment book before the `delete appointment 1` command executes to be saved in the `previousAppointmentLists`, and the currentAppointmentBookStatePointer still points to the current appointment book state.

![UndoState1](images/UndoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add appointment â€¦â€‹` to add a new appointment. The `add appointment` command also executes `previousAppointmentLists.push(new ArrayList<>(appointments.asUnmodifiableObservableList()))`, causing a copy of the current appointment book state to be saved into the `previousAppointmentLists`.

![UndoState2](images/UndoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not executes `previousAppointmentLists.push(new ArrayList<>(appointments.asUnmodifiableObservableList()))`, so the appointment book state will not be saved into the `previousAppointmentLists`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the appointment was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAppointmentBook()`, which will shift the `currentAppointmentBookStatePointer` to the most recently saved state, pointing it to the previous appointment book state, and restores the appointment book to that state.

![UndoState3](images/UndoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `previousAppointmentLists` is empty, then there are no previous AppointmentBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `commandHistory.empty()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the appointment book, such as `list`, will usually not executes `previousAppointmentLists.push(new ArrayList<>(appointments.asUnmodifiableObservableList()))`. Thus, the `previousAppointmentLists` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoState4.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire appointment/property book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
    
* **Alternative 2:** Saves only changes made by previous commands (Similar to commit and restore in version control).
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, may only save the appointment/property being deleted, and the deleted appointment/property is added back if the command is undone).
  * Cons: Difficult to implement, different implementations are required to restore different changes.
    
### \[Implemented\] Update feature

#### Implementation

The update mechanism is facilitated by `PocketEstate`. It implements the update feature with 3 parts, the `Status` field in `Property`, a `UpdateCommandParser` and `UpdateCommand`.

The `Status` field consists of a `Status` interface with a `next()` method that returns a `Status` representing the next stage of the property selling process. There are 3 classes that implement `Status`, `Option`, `SalesAgreement` and `Completion`. Each class takes in an `Offer` which represents the price that was offered for the property.

* `Option`â€‰â€”â€‰Represents the stage where the buyer exercises the Option to Purchase.
* `SalesAgreement`â€‰â€”â€‰Represents the stage where the buyer is considering the Sales and Purchase Agreement.
* `Completion`â€‰â€”â€‰Represents the stage where the property has been sold.

![StatusClassDiagram](images/StatusClassDiagram.png)

The `UpdateCommand` is assisted by 3 subcommands that extend the abstract class `UpdateCommand` which itself extends `Command`. The subcommands are, `UpdateNewCommand`, `UpdateProceedCommand` and `UpdateCancelCommand`. The subcommands help execute on the model when the user calls `u/new`, `u/proceed` or `u/cancel` respectively.

* `UpdateNewCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Takes in an `Index` and an Amount to create a new `Status` with the given Amount for the property at the given `Index`.
* `UpdateProceedCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Takes in an `Index` and moves the `Status` of the property at the given `Index` to the next `Status` if applicable.
* `UpdateNewCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Takes in an `Index` and removes the `Status` of the property at the given `Index` if applicable.

![UpdateCommandClassDiagram](images/UpdateCommandClassDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the update mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `PocketEstate` will be initialized with the initial appointment book state and property book state.

![UpdateStep1Initial](images/UpdateStep1Initial.png)

Step 2. The user executes `update 1 u/new 600,000` command to add a new status with value 600,000 to the first property.

![UpdateStep2New](images/UpdateStep2New.png)

Step 3. The user executes `update 1 u/proceed` to move the `Status` of the first property to `SalesAgreement`.

![UpdateStep3Proceed](images/UpdateStep3Proceed.png)

Step 4. The user executes `update 1 u/proceed` to move the `Status` of the first property to `Completion`.

![UpdateStep4Proceed](images/UpdateStep4Proceed.png)

Step 5. The user then decides that having the `Completion` status on the first property was a mistake and executes the command `update 1 u/cancel`.

## **Appendix A: Product scope**

**Target user profile**:

* property agent who has a need to manage a significant number of properties and appointments
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: PocketEstate enables easy organization of mass clientele property information through sorting of information by price, location and housing type, that may otherwise be difficult to manage.

## **Appendix G: Effort**

### Introduction
AB3 only dealt with one entity type, but PocketEstate took twice the effort since it involved 2 entity types - Properties & Appointments. The number of commands and attributes implemented were doubled in PocketEstate, signifying greater parsing, storage and tests effort due to the numerous different commands and data types involved.

To support all of that, we greatly expanded the application, increasing the lines of code from 6k to 16k. 

### New Features
**1. Update Command**
    
* Implementation of `update` command required effort due to addition of 3 sub commands, namely `new`, `proceed`, `cancel` commands. <br>
  `new` command introduces a new status attribute to each property for display in Ui. <br>
  `proceed` command moves status of the property to the next stage. <br>
  `cancel` command removes the status bar associated with that property. 

**2. Find Command**

* AB3â€™s `find` command only searched for existence of keywords in the Names of Properties and Appointments. <br>
  To make the `Find` command more useful and flexible, we expanded the `Find` command to apply keyword search in all attributes for Properties and Appointments. 

**3. Sort Command**

* Significant effort was required to implement individual comparators for each sorting key. <br>
  For example, supporting `sort` by name requires a comparator for the `name` attribute that provides alphabetical ordering while being case insensitive.

**4. Undo Command**

* Great effort was necessary to retrieve and store data in the AddressBook log, as well as to save the state of property and appointment books after each command.

### Challenges 1: User Interface

The user interface for original AddressBook was only optimised to display only one list. During the conceptualisation of PocketEstate, we struggled to find a way to display both property and appointments list in an organised but minimalist manner due to the numerous attributes associated with properties and appointments.

We found our original implementation of displaying one list at a time to be less user friendly as the user had to use `list property` or `list appointment` command before using other commands.

We overcame this by displaying both properties and appointments side by side for easy referral, without having to call `list property` or `list appointment` prior to a sort or filter. This design was also optimal in allowing find features that are simultaneously done on both lists. Eg. `find client [keyword]` where keyword is searched from both property and appointment lists.

The new UI structure of a side by side property and appointment list required a redesign of the user interface that was more complex, where we faced some sizing issues such as text wrapping, window issues due to the large amount of data displayed. In doing so, we also changed the colour scheme of the UI to be a light themed one in order to allow greater emphasis on some data (bolding of words) and less focus on other data Eg. Greying out of properties and appointments with expired deadlines. The original UI that was dark themed would not allow colour play with the different shades of black.

### Challenges 2: Parsing

Several attributes such as date, time and price are new attributes relative to AB3, so we have to implement parsing support for these attributes from scratch. The challenge was to provide maximum convenience to the user by allowing flexible inputs (such as having optional commas in prices), but at the same time ensuring correct input validation. To achieve this, a strict validation regex is implemented for all of the input attributes, and all input arguments for each attribute is validated upon the execution of a user command.

There was also a challenge in determining what was considered a valid or invalid input. Eg. How do we validate postal code / email. Such problems were further reviewed during the mock practical exam, where questions to what were considered valid inputs were further raised. By considering the suggestions of our peers, we improved our input validation by implementing stricter regex.

### Achievements:

1. User story - We originally planned to fulfill 15 [User stories](#appendix-b-user-stories), but exceeded expectation by adding new User stories upon addition of new features,  eventually fulfilling a total of 20 user stories.
2. Design - Kept the simplicity and cohesiveness of the features from the original AB3 project.

3. Testing - Provided extensive unit and manual testing on the product, making it reliable and efficient for production usage.
